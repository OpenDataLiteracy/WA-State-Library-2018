# Work Done This Week
# 22 June 2018

**Work plan update**
- Met with Washington State Librarian Cindy Aden, WSL direct supervisor Evelyn Lindberg and Will Saunders of OCIO to discuss what I’ll do this summer. 
- Updated my work plan to reflect these discussions with the sponsor, and submitted that updated plan to Evelyn, Cindy, Will and Nic Weber for review.
- NB: A meeting scheduled June 19 with the Washington State Archives had to be postponed, due to emergency rescue of Aberdeen Museum documents. Cindy wanted to see if the Archives’ work encouraging open data publishing might dovetail with my work. The meeting will be rescheduled.

**Organizing Data Equity for Main Street (DEMS) repository**
- Inventoried materials stored on the DEMS project site.
- Began a more detailed review of the curriculum guide and supporting materials, and reviewed message boards for evaluative commentary and additional material posted by participants.
- Met with DEMS project leader Debbie Faires to discuss what I’ll be doing, what to include in the repository, and which participating librarians I might talk to over the next 10 days to better understand what makes a library ready (or not) to be an open data champion. Summarized our meeting in a document, and will use this material to begin a draft for the repository structure.
- Sought platform recommendations from Evelyn, Will and Nic. 

**Assessment plan**
- Asked Nic for suggestions on user-centered-design/design-thinking faculty or doctoral students, whom I might consult about options for the WSL as it explores its potential role helping public libraries expand open data programs and services. 

**Set-up tasks**
- Set up my WSL work station, laptop, email and voicemail, and started getting to know my WSL colleagues.
- Registered with Medium and worked on getting the hang of GitHub for documenting my internship work. 
- Attended ODL lunch, met other interns, and reviewed internship expectations with Nic.

**Administrative**
- Spent a couple of hours on UW Workday onboarding tasks -- filling out forms, but also getting a handle on training or other things I needed to do. 
- Traveled to UW to show iSchool Human Resources my passport, to verify citizenship for the I-9 form.
