#  Data Equity for Main Street repository work

*As part of my internship work, I started a public repository for  materials generated by Data Equity for Main Street, a John S. and James L. Knight Foundation program in open data literacy curriculum at mostly public libraries in Washington State and California. This folder houses documents associated with that work.*

*The public repository was in process as of August 15, 2018, and will be available on GitHub.*
