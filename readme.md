This repository houses material generated by my summer 2018 [Open Data Literacy Project](http://odl.ischool.uw.edu/about/) internship with the Washington State Library, where I gathered information about open data activities at public libraries, as well as local government open data publishing. 

Please see the Final Reports folder for my narrative report, spreadsheets of findings, and Powerpoint slides of highlights. You can also visit *Medium* to read [my posts about this work](https://medium.com/@kesullivan591). 

You can reach me at kesullivan591@gmail.com with any corrections, suggestions or questions.
