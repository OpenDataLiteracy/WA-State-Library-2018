#  ODL Environmental Scan: ND10 Notes

*ND10 is a small municipal library serving under 5K people, without a certified librarian. The library is open 30 hours a week, M-Sa. Neither the city nor the surrounding county publishes open data, except for one GIS file that can be downloaded from the county.*

- The library doesn't appear to publish open data or host open data programming. The library does host Imagine Academy. Its calendar shows events about once a week directed at children (Storytime, Lego club).
- The library includes a Library Use Value Calculator that allows patrons to enter the materials they've checked out and then receive a $ return on their tax investment.
- The library's website includes links to a city strategic-planning group. 
- A page for the library's reports to the city council was last updated in February 2015.
