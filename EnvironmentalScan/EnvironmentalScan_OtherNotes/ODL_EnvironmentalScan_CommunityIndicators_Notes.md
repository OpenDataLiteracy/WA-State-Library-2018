#  ODL Environmental Scan: Notes on EWU's Community Indicators

## Appears to have a participatory design process for choosing which data to showcase.
- Varies by area, but EWU works with local government, ports, hospitals/health departments, chambers of commerce/business organizations, schools etc. to choose data

## How is the data updated? How are new data categories identified and added?
- E.g., Spokane Trends says the site launched in 2006, and a lot of data featured is updated through 2016, although some stop at 2012/2013.

## The sources are often federal, state or non-government local sources, so the Trends sites aren't galvanizing local open data publishing
- E.g., Spokane Trends' local cultural/tourism data is from the local business journal, visitor's bureau or similar orgs, regional council, PNW ski areas association, WA state auditor/WA DOR [are these locally generated data, reported to the state, though?], U.S. Dept of Commerce, U.S. Census.
