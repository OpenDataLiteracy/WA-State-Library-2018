## How the Library learned about Data Equity for Main Street
- DEMS1 heard about Data Equity at a state library association meeting, where Data Equity leaders presented the project.

## Why the Library chose to participate in Data Equity
### Organizational goals
- DEMS1 is the library director and made the decision to participate.
- The library had two reasons for participating.
    - The library had already set a strategic planning goal to be involved in a project with a research or experimental elements. Data Equity was such a project.
    - DEMS1 wanted to explore how data fit as a "collection element" in the library's future service to its community. (DEMS1 also explored virtual reality for the same reason -- was skeptical at first but found that VR may expand access to effective experiential learning.)
### Facilities
- The library had space, equipment and communication channels normally needed to launch classes.
### Staff comfort with technology
- DEMS1, who led instruction, has a background in data -- took the National Library of Medicine data series and, in previous consulting work, achieved blackbelt level in the Six Sigma process improvement system.

## How much of the Data Equity program did the library complete?
- DEMS1 attended Train-the-Trainer in Sacramento, tailored [*how did DEMS1 tailor curriculum*] and taught all four classes in May 2018 (once a week), the first two in the central library branch and the last two in another branch with a computer lab that better accommodated hands-on, interactive learning.

## How did the library promote the classes?
- The approach was similar to outreach for other educational events: email marketing, posters, flyers in the library and around a couple of other places.
- DEMS1 couldn't think of an obvious user group for targeted outreach. Normally DEMS1 would target an academic institution that had a data-driven curriculum (e.g., informatics, app development), but the one local community college doesn't have such a program.

## How successful was the Data Equity effort? What contributed to success?
- The first class, addressing the basics of open data, went well. Students could find open data sources addressing most of their questions.  
- DEMS1's data-friendly background, and library facilities all supported the effort.
- The Data Equity effort allowed the library to meet a strategic goal (participating in research or experimentation), and helped clarify where open data fits in the library's future.

## What could have been better with Data Equity? What hindered the effort?
- The library's service area may lack the typical target audience. The Data Equity classes were attended by only one or two people each. These members of the general public came with very specific reference-like questions (e.g., property issues, federal funding for abortion).
- DEMS1's local area doesn't have an open data portal, so there isn't an obvious go-to source for local questions.
- For a general member of the public and data non-specialist, open data doesn't seem that different from other information sources. The most common question in each of the classes was, "How is this different from other things I search on the internet?"

## What would the library do differently with future open-data efforts?
- Possibly do one-time classes that introduce the principles but target specific questions on particular topics, e.g., property ownership/disputes/taxes, crime etc.
- The current classes and titles didn't attract participants in DEMS1's area. "You might have to introduce it as, Here's something that's useful in your life, and -- also -- did you notice that it's associated with something cool and interesting? as opposed to the other way around.""
- Could tweak the timing. The classes were offered during work hours on weekdays; classes on Saturdays might attract different users.

## Should public libraries dive into open data?
- DEMS1 has mixed feelings about the value of data currently. DEMS1 believes that the best materials are tertiary ones that summarize a lot of different sources, give the user an overview and open the door for exploring further. Few people currently know how to handle data correctly, and very few have a need-based reason to use it in daily practice, which makes it currently more of a "boutique" collection element.
- However, DEMS1 still believes open data and libraries may have a future together.
    - DEMS1 believes reference librarians should know open data portals and be able to use them effectively. The reference librarian is that staff member who ideally is always looking for "better ways to find answers for their customers."
    - Open data empowers people to answer their own questions when no single source addresses the question, and command of open data reinforces information literacy, by building in verification and critical thinking (especially in a world where many parties use data to tell the story they want to tell). Empowerment, literacy and critical thinking are all core elements of the library's mission.
- DEMS1 also supports the broader spirit behind open data. DEMS1 finds the current publishing ecosystem unsustainable, and supports efforts to keep information from being hidden behind proprietary walls.

## Has the library advised local government about open data publishing?
- The library has had conversations with the local city about the benefits of open-data publishing.
- DEMS1 noted that on the one hand, intellectual freedom favors public records requests, but, as a public agency, the library is reluctant to encourage more public records requests, which often strain public agencies.
- Many public agencies have a lot of steps to take in records management before they even consider digitizing or publishing open data. Many localities will only undertake open data to avoid the pain of dealing with public records requests, DEMS1 said. When data is available by default through open data, "Instead of pulling a thousand records over the course of two years for a person, they could just write a letter back and say, 'It is available to you right here. Does that meet your information request?' Check! Done! ...That's the value case. ...[Librarians] can be advocates for that, for sure.''

## What would be the right next step on open data? What would make that step easier?
- The next step could be to help train staff in a nearby library system that's interested in Data Equity.
- If DEMS1 offers open data classes again, the classes will likely be one-time events that focus on property, crime or other popular, specific topics.
- If the state offered a data repository that would standardize the types and formats of data, and manage data in perpetuity, more localities might publish open data, DEMS1 said.
