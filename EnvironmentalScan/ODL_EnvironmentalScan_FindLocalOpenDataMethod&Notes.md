# ODL Environmental Scan: Finding Local Open Data Methodology & Notes

## Counties and cities
- Search "open data" + city/county name 
- Search city or county official website, then search for "data" 
- Sampling: Look at all counties and largest city by population in each county (using OFM's *Population Trends 2017*)
- Attempted to make spreadsheet listing of cities conform to OFM's list. Did not include cities with populations of <1,000

## State open data portals
- Explore various open data links on access.wa.gov to understand distinctions better

## Public library open data information
- Search "open data" in Google Advanced Search, limiting to library's domain. This appears to work better than searches on the libary site itself, as it at least dredges up earlier class listings.

## Notes
### Whatever the state of locally published open data, one can find open data *about* a locality
- data.gov
- mediator organizations, e.g., https://censusreporter.org/ (Knight Foundation project aimed at helping journalists use U.S. Census information)
- non-government open data, such as data collected by academic, scientific, activist organizations [*search repositories? other aggregators?*][*explore INFX551/CoolOpenData bookmarks*]
### Drivers of open data access at the local level
- Knight Foundation [*how many projects funded to ease access or rate open data availability?*]: 
- Code for America. Cited in San Diego government open portal launch. Active in San Jose as well. 
### Can libraries at least treat open data like any other collection element, i.e., pull together collections of open data about the region?
### What's the effect of legal disclaimers on users? Does this dampen the openness of the data?
- Skagit County *Data Use and Legal Responsibility by Users of County GIS Data* (https://www.skagitcounty.net/GIS/Documents/Misc/DDRF%20GI.pdf)
### State library opportunity: Create a lib guide page on open data publishing

## Future research
### Evaluate quality of open data provided, look more deeply at what data is filed under categories such as Environment, Housing 
### Why are some GIS services offered for a paid subscription in Clark Co.? Are these services offered for free by other county GIS sites? Is any meaningful access to public information behind the premium wall?
