#  ODL Environmental Scan: ND9

*ND9 is a small library serving under 5K people. The surrounding area is a recreational getaway. The library's immediate location doesn't publish open data; the surrounding county publishes GIS data, which appears to be fairly current and includes more than 75 datasets.*

- The library has an attractive website that incldues a page for viewing library statistics and instructions about how to get an Excel spreadsheet of data, or convert it to csv. (The statistics link appears to require authorization, though.)
- The library has a five-year plan on its website.
- The library director hosts a "digital happy hour" most Saturday afternoons. The other library programming appears to be mainly storytime and other schoolage-oriented events.
- The library is in a place of natural beauty, frequented by relatively affluent weekend-getaway visitors. A recent speaker in Fall 2017, for example, discussed her data collection on migrant birds, and another discussed a separate citizen science effort.
