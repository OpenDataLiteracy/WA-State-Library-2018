#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS4 Interview Notes

*DEMS4 is the integrated library systems coordinator for a California municipal library serving more than 1 million residents. The city and surrounding county both have open data portals, as well as a Code for America chapter (which advocated for the city launching an open data portal).*

## How did the library come to be involved in Data Equity for Main Street?
- The library director had heard about the project at the California Library Association conference and applied to the project. 
- The library director tapped DEMS4 to spearhead the Data Equity effort. DEMS4 has a background in data and statistics and is the "go-to" person for data and statistical questions for the library. DEMS4 is part of the library's IT team. Prior to 2013, DEMS4 was a reference librarian and social sciences subject librarian; DEMS4 also has a background in teaching and academia. 

## What Data Equity activities did the library undertake?
- DEMS4 helped develop the Data Equity curriculum. 
- The library led the four-course curriculum for the general public during the Alpha phase (Fall 2017).

## How did the library promote the classes?
- The classes were advertised to the general public, including on social media. 
- The library required registration to encourage attending all four classes. 

## What went well with the classes? What could have gone better?
- The classes were attended by about 16 people, at the start. 
- The library has good facilities, connectivity and equipment for teaching the curriculum. (DEMS4 said it's important to keep an eye on file sizes, since downloading a very large file can slow things down.)
- The library probably should have been clearer that the curriculum was aimed at beginners. Most class participants with more background in coding or data manipulation dropped out, but about eight participants (who tended to have general interest and less experience in working with data) continued for all four classes.
- The remaining participants were very engaged. Treasure hunts and analysis of deceptive visualizations were especially popular parts of the curriculum. The participants "had a lot of fun" with the Google mapping tools; DEMS4 agreed that instruction should feature data that is simply interesting or fun, as well as data that addresses particular research or policy issues.
- The Data Equity curriculum committee debated whether to have students all work on the same project, or pursue their own special projects. Based on the class experience, DEMS4 said it was better to have everyone working on the same project, on the same (vetted) open data sources. An alternative approach would be to give students an optional 20 minutes at the end to work on their own projects, with instructional support.

## What might be a next step on open data?
- The library has a Public Technology Services team, which might be the logical group to spearhead open data curriculum for the public, DEMS4 said. 

## What is the library's role in the local open data portal?
- The library is a participant and has contributed an inventory of possible datasets to publish, like other city agencies have done. The library does not currently have an advisory role with local government about open data publishing. 
- The library has only contributed Hours of Operation to the portal, but the library has data it can contribute and DEMS4 would like the library to contribute (e.g., circulation data). The city's performance/analytics department is still getting up and running, and may not have gotten around to the library yet, DEMS4 said.

## How much do open data services (publishing, instruction, advising) fit the library's mission?
- DEMS4 said open data fits well with the library's data literacy mission, and is also an important critical-thinking tool during a time when "we're getting an all-out assault on facts."
- The library also helps set standards for information quality, and has this role to play with open data, DEMS4 said. (DEMS4 notes that much open data has some reliability baked in, as it's published by government agencies held to certain standards.)

## Any external support (e.g., from a state library) that would aid the open data effort?
- No immediate options came to mind, DEMS4 said.
