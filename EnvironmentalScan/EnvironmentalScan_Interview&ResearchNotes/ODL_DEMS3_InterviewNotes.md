#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS3 Interview Notes

*DEMS3 is the director of a California municipal library serving about 200K people. The city doesn't have an open data portal; the surrounding county has some information and statistics online, but just a few Excel spreadsheets that can be downloaded.*

## Why did the library become involved in Data Equity for Main Street?
- Heard about the project from the California State LIbrary. 
- The library needs to use data for its own operations. Open data literacy also seemed to fit the library's mission to put information in the public's hands, DEMS3 said.
- "This is what we've always done -- grow and learn new things. This is a new literacy."

## What Data Equity activities has the library undertaken?
- DEMS3 conducted the curriculum for staff (April 2108), as well as 2-3 other library directors from the area. The classes were attended by about 8 to 12 people.
- The next step is to offer classes to the public. Other library systems may also be interested in training for their staffs.
    - The library may soon have a new programming and outreach librarian, which will advance open data events. 
    - Environmentalists and grass roots activists (the city is a seaside tourist area) might be particular users to reach out to, DEMS3 said. Teachers may be interested. The library already does some literacy work with the city's lower-income immigrant population, and open data could be folded in. Younger people in the area may be too busy trying to make ends meet to be engaged in open data. 
    - The key is figuring out how to make the curriculum responsive to the community's needs, not just something new. It might be good to offer classes in the fall, closer to the November election, for example, DEMS3 said.

## Went went well with the classes? What could have gone better?
- The content generated enthusiasm and momentum, and conversations about the content are continuing (e.g., about how to use data for grant applications), DEMS3 said. Most of the participants were new to open data. 
- The director is an enthusiastic user of technology , but DEMS3 says data is "not my strong suit."
- The library had some technical difficulties with the wifi network (although the librarian class participants coped well).
- Time and capacity are generally the greatest barriers to getting new programming underway -- the library is always "incredibly busy and short-handed," DEMS3 said.

## Does the library publish data?
- No. It's "on the list of things to do," DEMS3 said.

## What is the library's role in helping the city publish open data?
- The library doesn't currently work with the city or local government on open data or open government efforts. 
- The library has "an ongoing battle" being valued by other city leaders and working with city department heads who aren't always tech-savvy.
- Many city residents are relatively affluent but the local government isn't well funded. The library staff and budget is unlikely to grow in the next five years.

## What sort of support would help advance open data efforts?
- Marketing materials and tips.
