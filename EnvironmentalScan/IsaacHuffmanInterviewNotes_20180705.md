#  Interview Notes: Isaac Huffman, Director, Mount Vernon City Library

## How Mount Vernon City Library learned about Data Equity for Main Street
- Huffman heard about Data Equity at WLA, where Will Saunders and others presented the project

## Why Mount Vernon City Library chose to participate in Data Equity
### Organizational goals
- The library had already set a goal to be involved in a project with a research element. Data Equity was such a project.
- To lead. Huffman wanted to explore how data fit into the library's future service to its community. (He also explored virtual reality for the same reason -- was skeptical at first but found that VR may expand access to experiential learning.)
### Facilities
- Mount Vernon had access to space, equipment and communication channels normally needed to launch classes.
### Staff comfort with technology
- Huffman led on the project himself, i.e., attended Train-the-Trainer and then led instruction for the four classes. He has a background in data: He took the National Library of Medicine data series [*HSRIC? Check recording*] and achieved blackbelt level in the Six Sigma process improvement system. 

## How much of the Data Equity program did the library complete?
- Huffman attended Train-the-Trainer and taught all four classes, the first two in Mount Vernon and the last two in Burlington, where facilities better accommodated hands-on, interactive learning.

## How did the library promote the classes?
- Huffman said his approach was similar to outreach for other events: email listservs, posters, flyers in the library
- He couldn't think of an obvious user group to target. Even the local academic institution, Skagit Valley College, didn't have a data-intensive program. 

## How succesful was the Data Equity effort? What contributed to success?
- The same factors that led to participation also helped the effort -- Huffman's own expertise, the program's intersection with long-term strategic goals, and the existing space and equipment. 
- Open data literacy is consistent with traditional reference librarianship: matching sources with queries. 
- The first class, addressing the basics of open data, went really well. 

## What could have been better with Data Equity? What hindered the effort?
- The library's service area may lack the typical target audience. Mount Vernon's Data Equity classes were attended by only one or two people each. These members of the general public came with very specific questions about properties, or funding for abortion. 
- For a non-specialist, open data doesn't seem that different from other information sources. Command of open data is most handy when,
-- A tertiary source just doesn't exist. You either build the answer yourself, or you don't find the answer.
-- You need verification. 

## What would the library do differently with future open-data efforts?
- Possibly do one-shot classes on particular topics, e.g., property, crime etc. 

## Should public libraries dive into open data?
- Huffman has mixed feelings: Data as it "currently stands" won't be useful to most people, Huffman said, because most people really want a tertiary source that summarizes general findings from various reliable sources. That is, they want enough interpretation for the information to be digestible -- the key is that the interpretation be good. Open data is "fragmented," and often generated to answer a specific question; few people know how to use it, and few have a need-based reason to explore it, he said. 
- However, he still believes open data and libraries may have a future together. 
- Huffman believes reference librarians absolutely should know open data. 
- Open data empowers people to answer their own questions when no single source addresses the question, and command of open data reinforces information literacy, by building in verification and critical thinking (especially in a world where many parties use data to tell the story they want to tell).
- Huffman believes information management -- including management of data -- means making informed choices to save "meaningful" information, not everything because it "might" be useful someday. Information technology has made it tempting to save everything, he said. Finding meaning still requires human effort, even when we use machines to find patterns. 
- Huffman also supports the broader spirit behind open data. He finds the current publishing ecosystem unstainable, and suppports efforts to keep information from being hidden behind proprietary walls.

## Has the library advised local government about open data publishing?
- The Mount Vernon library has had conversations with local government about the benefits of open-data publishing. 
- Noted that on the one hand, intellectual freedom favors public records requests, but, as a public agency, they are reluctant to encourage more public records requests, which often strain public agencies. 
- Many public agencies have a lot of steps to take in records management before they even consider digitizing or publishing open data. 

## What would be the next right step on open data? What would make that step easier?
- If the state offered a data repository that would accept and manage data in perpetuity, more localities might publish open data (because the format and fields would be set, and long-term maintenance would be taken care of).
