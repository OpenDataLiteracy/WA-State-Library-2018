#  Environmental Scan Themes

##  Signs of readiness

### Open-data-friendly institutions do strategic planning. Plans specifically address open data or emphasize goals consistent with open data (e.g., transparency, innovation).
- Looking to be involved in research. DEMS1
- Looking for opportunities to explore data, early, to see how it fits in library mission. DEMS1, DEMS5
- Library's city had published an strategic plan that mentioned citizen participation, govt transparency and open data. DEMS2
- ND1's town has launched an open-govt initiative and published open data as part of this.
- ND5's mayor directed all city departments to make data as accessible as possible.

### Data-Equity and other open-data-services-participating libraries tend to be mid- and large-sized libraries.
- 250k and more: DEMS4, DEMS5, DEMS9, ND5 [but two more WA library systems may join DEMS]
- 100K-250K:  DEMS2, DEMS3, DEMS7
- 25K-100K: DEMS1, DEMS6 [two more library systems interested in joining DEMS]
- 5K-25K: DEMS8, DEMS10
- 5K and under: none

### Open data is often competing with other big projects or staff changes at libraries or publishing agencies.
- DEMS9 says staff changes at agencies account in part for slowing progress on open data.
- DEMS10 is bringing a new automation system on line.
- DEMS8 has been involved in a building project.
- DEMS2 said there's always another project.
- ND1 is migrating ILS, ND3 doesn't have lots of free time for finding new things. 

### Open data efforts prompt institutions to think about users and their concerns.
- DEMS1 noted difficulty in identifying target users outside of the general public. 
- DEMS2's open data efforts trained their attention on public concerns, such as economic development, homelessness and opioid abuse.
- DEMS5 interview affirmed this.
#### Open data instruction or promotion can be challenging where constituencies lack obvious research-driven questions or user groups (e.g., academics, activists)
- DEMS1, DEMS3, DEMS7, ND3 (educated but not necessarily activist/research-driven users, even when citizens are upset about something with city govt; ND3 is aware of user characteristics, and a lot of the population comes thru the door, as ND3 is also the main meeting space in town)

### Libraries that are interested in the future and serving constituencies see open data as a good exploratory tool.
- DEMS1  
- DEMS5 
- DEMS8 (we need to get on board now and try open data out)

### Open data appeals to libraries for internal use and professional development.
- Can help the library better leverage data to demonstrate value. DEMS6, DEMS3
- ND5 wonders if this is actually one of the best focuses for data management.

### Open-data-friendly institutions have staff that are enthusiastic about technology (or at least aren't afraid of it).
- DEMS1 has strong background in data use.
- DEMS2a is an enthusiast, and DEMS2 library system has multiple staff members involved in data and digitization.
- DEMS5
- DEMS8 already participates in digital literacy training thru State Library 
- Technology-specific staff : ND1 (technology manager), ND3 (part-time associate for tech instruction), ND5 is a data analyst, ND6 has TechTues drop-in events. ND9 has data-friendly events (often focused on environmentalism) and puts statistics on its website.
#### ...Or the library doesn't have strong data staffing or capacity, and this is a challenge for open-data efforts.
- But DEMS10 has staff that aren't necessarily computer-savvy and needed a foundation in online searching and Boolean operators before diving into open data content.
- ND4 has no data wrangler on staff (or marketing person; staff is generally lean).
- DEMS4 is the "go-to" staff member on data and analytics (for internal use)

### Open-data-friendly institutions have at least adequate facilities for programs and services.
- DEMS1, DEMS2, DEMS4 
- DEMS5 has outstanding facilities and equipment.
#### ...and open-data is harder when they don't have such space
- ND8's library has a conference room but not ideal enclosed space for instruction.

### How do libraries get involved with Data Equity or learn about open data?
- Knowing DEMS leaders, involvement in previous access work (Will S., Debbie F., Anne N): DEMS9
- Listserve: DEMS6
- State library: DEMS3 (CA), DEMS78 (WA)
- Library conference: DEMS1?, DEMS2, DEMS5, DEMS4
- Who among NDs is aware of DEMS? 

## Open data library/government collaborations
### Open-data collaborations between libraries and governments sometimes coincide with new leadership taking over (on either side) OR the government has leadership that recognizes the library's value as a partner.
- DEMS2 just got a new director (although outgoing director was also open-data friendly), and the city just got a new mayor. The city's IT director recognized the library's value as an open-data partners.
- DEMS9 joined the library at the same time the government was getting a new IT director, and the two were able to establish trust and a working relationship.
- Libraries need to be assertive and not wait to be asked. This has worked repeatedly for DEMS5, where librarians already participate in data privacy, emergency management and educational policy. 
- ND1 (with interest in future open data efforts) has had new director in last few year, and new technology manager. 
#### ...Or are challenged by leadership that's been there a long time.
- City leaders consider DEMS3 new, after 10 years. 
- On the other hand, DEMS8 has known leaders for a while, and is focused on prodding them into publishing. 

### Institutions (both government and libraries) are trying to figure out how to prioritize "meaningful" data that will engage users and build participation.
- Will Saunders said in DEMS2 meeting that "overpublishing and undermanaging is the usual scenario," but it's better (by all measures) to start smaller with what users really most want and need. DEMS2 Basecamp discussion asks what's meaningful to DEMS2's city? DEMS2 notes business development and homelessness/opiod abuse as issues that the public cares about. 
- DEMS1 said [IT culture/staff] tend to want to preserve everything, which is not productive. Librarians are trained to weed. 
- DEMS5 talks about need for policies that produce sustainable, continuous open data publishing. The city's current portal is low-quality and underused by both publishers and the public. 
- DEMS9 says the local government is in a holding pattern on open data, because departments need to catch up and understand why they're publishing, as well as how to publicize their open data. (Libraries are particularly helpful in educating agencies about the importance and benefits of working openly, DEMS9 said.) The area could benefit from community conversations that identify the most meaningful data to the public, DEMS9 said. 
- The EWU Community Indicators project chooses data based on focus groups with community leaders, and is a must-study case for data publishing.
- If locals see open data that's meaningful to them, this will boost enthusiasm for using and learning more about open data, DEMS8 said. 
- Library staff spent a while thinking about what data would be useful and interesting to the public, ND5 said.

### The library as trusted adviser to government open-data publishers recognizes the library's unique expertise in technology, user experience, using data to demonstrate value. 
- DEMS2 was cheered that city IT identified the library as a valuable expert on user experience. DEMS2a noted that libraries are experienced in using data to demonstrate value. DEMS2b commented on how libraries can help other agencies appreciate the benefits of working openly and being open about information (instead of trying to hide potential problems).
- DEMS5 affirmed all of these factors behind library expertise. 
- DEMS9: The library is a "friendlier" adviser than someone from the city's IT department, DEMS9 said. The library is all about information, and doesn't have an ulterior motive in advising people about the best information practices, DEMS9 said. 
-  Can see an advisory role for the library eventually, because of these areas of expertise, ND1, ND2, ND5 (although no such partnership now), ND6.
#### ...Or, the library is challenged by relationships with government/community leaders.
- The library has "an uphill battle" being valued by other city leaders, DEMS#3. Many city residents are relatively affluent but the local government isn't well funded. The library staff and budget is unlikely to grow in the next five year.
- The library needs to rebuild relationships with government and community leadership, ND4. Data actually helps with this effort, since it allows the library to better demonstrate its value (ND4).

### Open data publishers benefit from knowing that the data is used.
- Government publishers often find user feedback encouraging and motivating. Without feedback, publishers feel like they are publishing into a void, and simply fulfilling yet another organizational directive. Will S. said having DEMS2's library ask about a missing dataset moved things much faster than having a supervisor ask about it.
- One of the benefits of focusing on internal use of data is that agencies see the whole lifecycle, and the benefits of using data. ND5, DEMS5

### Open data publishers benefit from better internal management and use of data.
- City departments in DEMS5's area can't share data adequately, which hobbles collaborative efforts. ND5 said this as well. 
- Libraries can use data even more effectively to demonstrate value, DEMS5. And see if internal efforts are resulting in the hoped-for outcomes, ND5. 

### Excellent data management also benefits city departments and other interdependent agencies internally.
- DEMS5: One benefit to smoothing out data management is allowing different city departments to share data with each other and collaborate more efficiently and effectively (e.g., in flood relief efforts). ND5, too. 

### Tension can exist between the advisory role and library ethical obligations 
- Will Saunders notes that libraries must be careful to convey user experience without compromising patron confidentiality (DEMS2: freedom to search without being tracked). 
- ND5 noted the library took care not to publish location on timestamped checkout datasets, to avoid information that could lead to identification.
- DEMS1 notes that public records requests are part of intellectual freedom and transparent government (which are important to patrons and part of library values), but they are also a strain on fellow public agencies (which the library advises). 

## Takeaways from carrying out curriculum

### What's gone well/what's enticing about offering open data curriculum 
- Enthusiasm, engaged participants. DEMS4, DEMS7 (participants drove across town to attend), DEMS9
- Collaboration among libraries. DEMS2, DEMS9.
- Participating helps libraries clarify the role of open data in future work. DEMS1, ND5
- Curriculum is sound. DEMS7, DEMS2, DEMS9, DEMS3, (Open data basics especially, DEMS1)
- Curriculum can be tailored to audience. DEMS9. Combining 1&2, 3&4, minimizing metadata worked well, DEMS7.
- Staff are extremely enthusiastic and positive when they attend training, and staff attend in large numbers. DEMS5, DEMS8 also reports enthusiastic staff. ND5, too. 
- Treasure hunts, DEMS4
- Mapping/vis tools DEMS4, DEMS7 
- Analyzing deceptive visualization, DEMS4

### Challenges in hosting open-data classes/concerns about investing in open data curriculum
- Outreach/marketing is critical DEMS5. Marketing was off the mark (DEMS7, biz-related classes marketed by a third party)
- Time and capacity, always. DEMS2 (where the library and city are in a budget crisis and hiring freeze), DEMS3, DEMS8 (consumed by building project), ILS migration and other project (ND1), regular busy-ness (ND3)
-  Constituencies without obvious research-driven user groups, e.g., academic institutions, businesses or other user groups that might want to use primary sources to answer research questions. DEMS1. ND2 believes a niche crowd would be interested, e.g., those who make public records requests now. ND3 not sure the service population would be research-driven to use open data.
- Political cultural that doesn't fund or value any public institutions, DEMS3.
- Library has fundamental strategic issues to address, such as talking to its public and government/community leaders, ND4.
- Low attendance at classes for the public, especially relative to marketing effort. DEMS9, ND5 (even after extraordinary outreach), DEMS1, DEMS7, DEMS8 (general public classes), ND6 (patrons ask for computer classes and then don't come to them)
- Attendees had very specific issues to pursue, vs. general interest. DEMS1
- Technical difficulties (wifi capacity, DEMS3), participants didn't have their own laptops (DEMS7, biz classes)
- Open data isn't always easy to distinguish from other reference sources, some of which provide more context and (helpful, high-quality) interpretation. DEMS1
- Classes lay the foundation for future questions, which may take a while to evolve, but access is the first step toward literacy. (People need some education -- a "little hook" -- as a foundation for having further questions, DEMS9 said. As open data publishing evolves and provides more context and narrative (e.g., publishing an article about the hot public topic of potholes, then providing user-friendly links to data on the righthand side), more people will be interested in open data, DEMS9 said.) DEMS9, DEMS5.

### Open data's unique strengths as a resource.
- Source when no other source has built the answer already. DEMS1, DEMS8
- Open to manipulation and visualization. DEMS8
- A tool for fostering critical thinking. DEMS1, DEMS2.
- A means of vetting or inspecting others' conclusions and interpretations. DEMS1

### Users are interested in data to solve problems, but they also want to have fun or be amazed by something cool.
- The historic trees dataset. DEMS2a/Will S.
- Sports data discussion on BaseCamp
- Agreement DEMS4

### Possible next steps
- Classes for the general public, possibly around the fall election, perhaps to targeted users such as environmentalists. DEMS3, DEMS6
- Perhaps another round of classes, but to targeted users: DEMS9
- Offer future instruction to staff, DEMS5, DEMS10, ND5 (a possibility), ND6 (i.e, use training to be ready for drop-in questions)
- Develop measures for the impact of open data education, DEMS5.
- Develop e-curriculum that can be embedded in a library site or an open data portal, DEMS5.
- A new staff member may help advance open data efforts. DEMS3, DEMS5, DEMS9
- Another staff member or library group may take over open data services, DEMS4
- Fold open data into other existing programs and curriculum, such as health literacy, DEMS6
- One-shot classes, focused on a particular subject such as property or crime, although the instructor can use practical issues to pique attendees imagination and curiosity. DEMS1
- Using curriculum to teach other city departments first, ahead of city's open data portal launch. Possibly timing classes for the public closer to the city's portal launch. DEMS2
- Encourage more local agencies to publish open data. DEMS8, ND6 (maybe)
- Teaching open data curriculum, or taking a bigger role in the local town's open data efforts, ND1.

## Libraries' future with open data
### Open data connects to many core traditional library functions.
- Open data is part of reference librarianship, intellectual freedom, education/empowerment, critical thinking DEMS1, DEMS2, DEMS4
- LIbraries help set standards for reliable information, and libraries can do so with open data, DEMS4
- Libraries are about information. DEMS2, DEMS6, DEMS5, DEMS9, DEMS8
- Libraries are the original open source people. Open data is the library's future. DEMS9, DEMS5.
- Open data is a new literacy, and libraries need to be on top of it. DEMS9, DEMS5, DEMS3. "We're giving people what they want if they knew about it," DEMS6.
- Reference librarians and other key staff should absolutely be trained on open data. DEMS1, DEMS9, DEMS7, (ND5, note success of staff training for these librarians)
- Open data advances a better publishing ecosystem, one that doesn't hide information behind proprietary walls. DEMS1

## Suggestions about how to support open data efforts at public libraries 
- State-supported data repository, which would standardize format and provide long-term management. DEMS1
- Infrastructure, such as a platform that supports an open data portal, ND8.
- Virtually any capacity support -- toolkits, professional development, tips. DEMS2, DEMS9, DEMS8, ND1. DEMS was perfect for DEMS6, for example, because it was "just what was needed, when it was needed." ND6
- Ready-to-use curriculum (asked for), ND1.ND6 
- Ready-to-use marketing materials, such as flyers. DEMS2, DEMS5, DEMS3
- Leadership/advocacy training and tips about starting points with government, DEMS5. (DEMS3 maybe)
- Reassure libraries that these are long-term efforts, DEMS5.
- Talk with libraries and local governments, even if they aren't quite ready for open data. Figure out where they are now. DEMS5
- Curated list of open data resources, with annotations. ND3

## Libraries working with local government on publishing open data
- DEMS2
- DEMS5 is interested in such a partnership and already works with local government on other projects
- DEMS9. The government and the library are also talking about sharing a data-related position.
### Libraries that have informally talked to local officials about open data publishing, and would be open to advocating for open data/better data with government. 
- Many localities will only undertake open data to avoid the pain of dealing with public records requests, DEMS1 said. When data is available by default through open data, "Instead of pulling a thousand records over the course of two years for a person, they could just write a letter back and say, 'It is available to you right here. Does that meet your information request?' Check! Done! ...That's the value case. ...[Librarians] can be advocates for that, for sure.'' DEMS1
- ND5
### Libraries with good working relationships with other agencies, interested in helping them publish open data (VISIT THESE)
- DEMS8
- ND6 
### Libraries interested in being at the table for local government open-data efforts
- ND4, ND1 (can see an advocacy/advising role in the future), ND2

## Libraries interested in hosting open data portals (for library and other data)
- DEMS9 very interested but it's still subject to negotiation.
- ND8 very interested, attended PLA session on this recently.

# Future research & ODL/WSL collaboration opportunities
- Look for signs of readiness in local government to move toward more or better open data, such as open-government documentation on the website. Are there other probably target user groups for open data in the area? For example, academic institutions, tech-driven industry, journalists, schools, activists or others who use  research questions and would be interested in open data?
- Talk to city and community leaders in DEMS2 and DEMS9 areas, to learn more about why partnerships with the library are working. Visit sites where the library leadership already has a close relationship with local government, (ND6 & DEMS8), or is reaching out to public and government (ND4), or has an interest (ND1). ND9's website indicates a friendliness to data, too. 
- Help ND4 publish opsen data about its conversation project.
- Continue talking to public library systems in the state, and survey more county libraries. (Most in the sample ended up being municipal libraries -- are most library systems in this category, or are most in this category at a certain population size?) Use surveys when they make sense, but recognize that one may benefit most from rich, qualitative methods when trying to understand readiness.
- Go to the next level on the WA counties/cities spreadsheet -- taking a closer look at the quality of publishing, getting more precise information about the categories and volume of data published, filling in more localities, surveying at least health departments.
    - Learn more about Clark County's Premium GIS arrangement. Is that unusual? 
- Help the state library gain a few Tim Berners-Lee stars in its own publishing -- one big rectangle, a little friendly invitation text on the page, DOI and links to other data.
- Pull together a Research Guide page for public libraries, providing toolkits, starting points for publishing open data, working with local government and connecting patrons to open data (through one-on-one, instruction, e-curriculum, collections/lib guides). Connect libraries to available training through the State Library (Tami).
- Encourage libraries to create collections/guides to local open data (me) 
- Work with Elizabeth I. on embedded e-curriculum.
- Connect open data to State Library services, such as youth services, tribal libraries, Worksource. Nono has expertise in ArcGIS Storymaps.
- Help develop e-curriculum on open data.
