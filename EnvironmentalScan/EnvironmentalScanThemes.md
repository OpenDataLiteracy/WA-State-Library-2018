#  Environmental Scan Themes


##  Signs of readiness
### Open-data-friendly institutions do strategic planning. Plans specifically address open data or emphasize goals consistent with open data (e.g., transparency, innovation).
-DEMS1
-DEMS2

### Institutions need to be big enough to have capacity for open data programming, but not so big that they can't act quickly. 
- DEMS1
- DEMS2
- DEMS participating libraries in Washington State draw heavily from mid-sized library systems.
- DEMS5 is an exception; it's a big library system and it seems to move nimbly. 

### Open data is often competing with other big projects or staff changes at libraries or publishing agencies.
- DEMS9 says staff changes at agencies account in part for slowing progress on open data.

### Open data efforts prompt institutions to think about users and their concerns.
- DEMS1 noted difficulty in identifying target users outside of the general public. 
- DEMS2's open data efforts trained their attention on public concerns, such as economic development, homelessness and opioid abuse.
- DEMS5 interview affirmed this.

### Libraries that are interested in the future and serving constituencies see open data as a good exploratory tool.
- DEMS1  
- DEMS5 

### Open-data-friendly institutions have staff that are enthusiastic about technology (or at least aren't afraid of it).
- DEMS1 has strong background in data use.
- DEMS2a is an enthusiast, and DEMS2 library system has multiple staff members involved in data and digitization.
- DEMS5

### Open-data-friendly institutions have at least adequate facilities for programs and services.
- DEMS1 
- DEMS2 
- [*Is connectivity an issue?*]
- DEMS5 has outstanding facilities and equipment.

### How do libraries get involved with Data Equity or learn about open data?
- Knowing DEMS leaders, involvement in previous access work (Will S., Debbie F., Anne N): DEMS9
- Listserve: DEMS6
- Library conference: DEMS1?, DEMS2, DEMS5s

## Open data library/government collaborations
### Open-data collaborations between libraries and governments sometimes coincide with new leadership taking over (on either side) OR the government has leadership that recognizes the library's value as a partner.
- DEMS2 just got a new director (although outgoing director was also open-data friendly), and the city just got a new mayor. The city's IT director recognized the library's value as an open-data partners.
- DEMS9 joined the library at the same time the government was getting a new IT director, and the two were able to establish trust and a working relationship.
- Libraries need to be assertive and not wait to be asked. This has worked repeatedly for DEMS5, where librarians already participate in data privacy, emergency management and educational policy. 

### Institutions (both government and libraries) are trying to figure out how to prioritize "meaningful" data that will engage users and build participation.
- Will Saunders said in DEMS2 meeting that "overpublishing and undermanaging is the usual scenario," but it's better (by all measures) to start smaller with what users really most want and need.
- DEMS1 said [IT culture/staff] tend to want to preserve everything, which is not productive. Librarians are trained to weed. 
- DEMS5 talks about need for policies that produce sustainable, continuous open data publishing. The city's current portal is low-quality and underused by both publishers and the public. 
- DEMS9 says the local government is in a holding pattern on open data, because departments need to catch up and understand why they're publishing, as well as how to publicize their open data. (Libraries are particularly helpful in educating agencies about the importance and benefits of working openly, DEMS9 said.) The area could benefit from community conversations that identify the most meaningful data to the public, DEMS9 said. 
- The EWU Community Indicators project chooses data based on focus groups with community leaders, and is a must-study case for data publishing.

### The library as trusted adviser to government open data publishers recognizes the library's unique expertise in technology, user experience, using data to demonstrate value. 
- DEMS2 was cheered that city IT identified the library as a valuable expert on user experience
- DEMS5 affirmed all of these factors behind library expertise. 
- DEMS9: The library is a "friendlier" adviser than someone from the city's IT department, DEMS9 said. The library is all about information, and doesn't have an ulterior motive in advising people about the best information practices, DEMS9 said. 

### Open data publishers benefit from knowing that the data is used.
- Government publishers often find user feedback encouraging and motivating. Without feedback, publishers feel like they are publishing into a void, and simply fulfilling yet another organizational directive. Will S. said having DEMS2's library ask about a missing dataset moved things much faster than having a supervisor ask about it.
- One of the benefits of focusing on internal use of data is that agencies see the whole lifecycle, and the benefits of using data. ND5, DEMS5

### Open data publishers benefit from better internal management and use of data.
- City departments in DEMS5's area can't share data adequately, which hobbles collaborative efforts.
- Libraries can use data even more effectively to demonstrate value, DEMS5.

### Excellent data management also benefits city departments and other interdependent agencies internally.
- DEMS5: One benefit to smoothing out data management is allowing different city departments to share data with each other and collaborate more efficiently and effectively (e.g., in flood relief efforts).

### Tension can exist between the advisory role and library ethical obligations 
- Will Saunders notes that libraries must be careful to convey user experience without compromising patron confidentiality (DEMS2: freedom to search without being tracked)
- DEMS1 notes that public records requests are part of intellectual freedom and transparent government (which are important to patrons and part of library values), but they are also a strain on fellow public agencies (which the library advises). 

## Takeaways from carrying out curriculum

### What's gone well/what's enticing about offering open data curriculum 
- Collaboration among libraries. DEMS2, DEMS9.
- Curriculum is solid and can be tailored to audience. DEMS9.
- Staff are extremely enthusiastic and positive when they attend training, and staff attend in large numbers. DEMS5.

### Challenges in hosting open-data classes/concerns about investing in open data curriculum
- Outreach/marketing is critical, but time-consuming and difficult to do effectively. DEMS5
- Low attendance at classes for the public, especially relative to marketing effort. DEMS9, ND5.
- Classes lay the foundation for future questions, which may take a while to evolve, but access is the first step toward literacy. (People need some education -- a "little hook" -- as a foundation for having further questions, DEMS9 said. As open data publishing evolves and provides more context and narrative (e.g., publishing an article about the hot public topic of potholes, then providing user-friendly links to data on the righthand side), more people will be interested in open data, DEMS9 said.) DEMS9, DEMS5.

### Users are interested in data to solve problems, but they also want to have fun or be amazed by something cool.
- The historic trees dataset. DEMS2a/Will S.
- Sports data discussion on BaseCamp

### Possible next steps
- Perhaps another round of classes, but to targeted users: DEMS9
- Offer future instruction to staff, DEMS5. 
- Develop measures for the impact of open data education, DEMS5.
- Develop e-curriculum that can be embedded in a library site or an open data portal, DEMS5.
- A new staff member may help advance open data efforts. DEMS3, DEMS5, DEMS9.

## Libraries' future with open data
### Open data connects to many core traditional library functions.
- Open data is part of reference librarianship, intellectual freedom, education/empowerment, critical thinking DEMS1, DEMS2
- Libraries are the original open source people. Open data is the library's future. DEMS9, DEMS5.
- Open data is a new literacy, and libraries need to be on top of it. DEMS9, DEMS5. 
- Reference librarians and other key staff should absolutely be trained on open data. DEMS1, DEMS9.

## Suggestions about how to support open data efforts at public libraries 
- State-supported data repository, which would standardize format and address long-term management. DEMS1
- Virtually any capacity support -- toolkits, professional development, tips. DEMS2, DEMS9
- Ready-to-use marketing materials, such as flyers. DEMS2, DEMS5
- Leadership/advocacy training and tips, DEMS5.
- Reassure libraries that these are long-term efforts, DEMS5.s

# Future research & ODL/WSL collaboration opportunities
- Look for signs of readiness in local government to move toward more or better open data, such as open-government documentation on the website. Are there other probably target user groups for open data in the area? For example, academic institutions, tech-driven industry, journalists, schools, activists or others who use  research questions and would be interested in open data?
- Talk to city and community leaders in DEMS2 and DEMS9 areas, to learn more about why partnerships with the library are working. Visit sites where the library leadership already has a close relationship with local government. 
- Continue talking to public library systems in the state, and survey more county libraries. (Most in the sample ended up being municipal libraries -- are most library systems in this category, or are most in this category at a certain population size?) Use surveys when they make sense, but recognize that one may benefit most from rich, qualitative methods when trying to understand readiness.
- Go to the next level on the WA counties/cities spreadsheet -- taking a closer look at the quality of publishing, getting more precise information about the categories and volume of data published, filling in more localities, surveying at least health departments.
- Help the state library gain a few Tim Berners-Lee stars in its own publishing -- one big rectangle, a little friendly invitation text on the page, DOI and links.
- Pull together a Research Guide page for public libraries, providing toolkits, starting points for publishing open data, working with local government and connecting patrons to open data (through one-on-one, instruction, e-curriculum, collections/lib guides)
- Encourage libraries to create collections/guides to local open data (me) 
- Work with Elizabeth I. on embedded e-curriculum
- Connect open data to State Library services, such as youth services, tribal libraries, Worksource.
