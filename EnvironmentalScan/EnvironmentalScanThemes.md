#  Environmental Scan Themes

*The following are possible signs of readiness for a library or locality to undertake open data programs and services.

## Open-data-friendly institution do strategic planning. Plans specifically address open data or emphasize goals consistent with open data (e.g., transparency, innovation).
-DEMS1
-DEMS2

## Institutions need to be big enough to have capacity for open data programming, but not so big that they can't act quickly. 
- DEMS1
- DEMS2
- DEMS participating libraries in Washington State draw heavily from mid-sized library systems.

## Institutions are trying to figure out how to prioritize "meaningful" data that will engage users and build participation.
- Will Saunders said in DEMS2 meeting that "overpublishing and undermanaging is the usual scenario," but it's better (by all measures) to start smaller with what users really most want and need.
- DEMS1 said [IT culture/staff] tend to want to preserve everything, which is not productive. Librarians are trained to weed.

## Open data efforts prompt institutions to think about users and their concerns.
- DEMS1 noted difficulty in identifying target users outside of the general public. 
- DEMS2's open data efforts trained their attention on public concerns, such as economic development, homelessness and opioid abuse.

## Institutions that are focused adapting to serve constituencies see open data as a good exploratory tool.
-DEMS1 said open data was important to explore, in order to 

## Open-data-friendly institutions have staff that are enthusiastic about technology (or at least aren't afraid of it).
- DEMS1 has strong background in data use.
- DEMS2a is an enthusiast, and DEMS2 library system has multiple staff members involved in data and digitization.

## Open-data-friendly institutions have at least adequate facilities for programs and services.
- DEMS1 
- DEMS2 
- [*Is connectivity an issue?*]

## Open data connects to many core traditional library functions.
- DEMS1: Clear reference librarianship and critical-thinking/literacy function.
- DEMS2: Reference, intellectual freedom, education/empowerment, critical thinking

## The library as trusted adviser to government open data publishers recognizes the library's unique window on user experience, but also may introduce tension between advisory role and library values
- DEMS2 was cheered that city IT identified the library as a valuable expert on user experience
- Will Saunders notes that libraries must be careful to convey user experience without compromising patron confidentiality (DEMS2: freedom to search without being tracked)
- DEMS1 notes that public records requests are part of intellectual freedom and transparent government (which are important to patrons and part of library values), but they are also a strain on fellow public agencies (which the library advises). 

## Institutions welcome support from the state, and have suggestions
- DEMS1: State-supported data repository, which would standardize format and address long-term management.
- DEMS2: Virtually any capacity support
- DEMS2: Ready-to-use materials, such as marketing flyers.
