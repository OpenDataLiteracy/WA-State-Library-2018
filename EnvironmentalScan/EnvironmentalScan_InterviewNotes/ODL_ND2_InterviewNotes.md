#  ND2 Interview Notes

Interview conducted 23 July 2018
ND2 is the director of a municipal library serving about 55K people, between the city itself and some patrons from just outside the city.

## What is the library's service community like?
- ND2 describes the area as an "industrial town" that is becoming more of a retirement community. The local economy has not bounced back as much as the economy generally. The Latino population has grown and may be about 10 percent of the community now. The area also has a Southeast Asian immigrant community, although many of these households arrived in the '70s and '80s. 

## What kind of programming does the library do now? 
- Technology training and adult literacy accounts for a lot of the library's event programming. ND2 says the community overall is not as tech-savvy as, for example, the Puget Sound area. 

## What is the library's relationship to local government?
- The library is a city department. ND2 regularly meets with other city officials, and reports to the city manager. 
- As a city department, the library has an advisory board rather than board of directors. 

## Does the library currently publish its own data?
- Not consistently. The library uses data internally for quality improvement and evaluation, but doesn't publish it.

## Does the local government publish open data?
- No. 

## How might open data fit into the library's future and the needs of its service community?
- Public records requests are an issue for other city departments. ND2 sees a solid role for the library in helping local government launch open data, for reasons that have come up in other library-government partnerships (i.e., the library is technology savvy, interacts daily with users, and is experienced using data to demonstrate value). 
- ND2 believes the library's community would have an interest in open data literacy curriculum, such as that of Data Equity for Main Street. The likely user group would be the same citizens now making records requests, ND2 said. Certainly if the local government began publishing open data, the library would want to launch programming to help patrons use it, ND2 said.
