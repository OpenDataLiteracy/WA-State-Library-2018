#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS3 Interview Notes

*DEMS3 is the director of a California municipal library serving about 200K people. The city doesn't have an open data portal; the surrounding county has some information and statistics online, but just a few Excel spreadsheets that can be downloaded.*

## Why did the library become involved in Data Equity for Main Street?
- The library needs to use data for its own operations. Open data literacy also seemed to fit the library's mission to put information in the public's hands, DEMS3 said.
- "This is what we've always done -- grow and learn new things. This is a new literacy."

## What Data Equity activities has the library undertaken?
- DEMS3 conducted the curriculum for staff, as well as other local library directors in the area. The classes were attended by about 8 to 10 people.
- The next step is to offer classes to the public. 
    - The library may soon have a new programming and outreach librarian, which will advance open data events. 
    - Environmentalists and grass roots activists might be particular users to reach out to, DEMS3 said.
    - The key is figuring out how to make the curriculum responsive to the community's needs. It might be good to offer classes in the fall, closer to the November election, for example, DEMS3 said.

## Went went well with the classes? What could have gone better?
- The content generated enthusiasm and momentum, and conversations about the content are continuing, DEMS3 said.
- The library had some technical difficulties with the wifi network. 
- Time and capacity are generally the greatest barriers to getting new programming underway -- the library is always "incredibly busy and short-handed," DEMS3 said.

## What is the library's role in helping the city publish open data?
- The library doesn't currently work with the city or local government on open data or open government efforts. 
- The library has "an uphill battle" being valued by other city leaders.
- Many city residents are relatively affluent but the local government isn't well funded. The library staff and budget is unlikely to grow in the next five years.

## What sort of support would help advance open data efforts?
- Marketing materials and tips.
