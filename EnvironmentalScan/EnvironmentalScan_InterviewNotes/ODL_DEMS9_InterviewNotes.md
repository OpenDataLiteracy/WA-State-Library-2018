#  ODL DEMS9 Interview Notes

*DEMS9 is the community technology director at large municipal library (100K-250K people served). Its city and county both have open data portals, and the city and library are collaborating on open data services. DEMS9 has a long professional history in public access to technology and information.

## How did the library become involved in the local government's open data efforts?
- DEMS9 started her position around the same time that the city's new chief technology officer came on board. As the two got to know and trust one another, open data emerged as a project they could collaborate on.
- This was a huge leap forward for the city and library, which previously never did anything together, DEMS9 said.

## What is the library's role in the open data effort?
- The library has been a partner in spearheading the city's open data launch. 
- The effort is in a holding pattern at the moment, in part because of staffing changes and mostly because city departments need more time and training to understand the benefits of open data publishing -- not only the value of avoiding unnecessary public records requests, but using data to tell a story. The publishing entities need to believe in the benefits, or they won't generate good data consistently, DEMS9 said.
- The city is also looking for a new data staff member (architect) to assist with technical matters, with the city and library negotiating about who will supervise the position.
- DEMS9 would ultimately prefer that the library host the open data portal and become "the place for open data," but this is still under negotiation.

## What experience and expertise makes the library a reliable partner in this effort? 
- The library is a "friendlier" adviser than someone from the city's IT department, DEMS9 said. The library is all about information, and doesn't have an ulterior motives in advising people about the best information practices, DEMS9 said. 

## Is the library publishing open data about itself now?
- No. DEMS9 hopes to publish a few datasets in the near future.

## How did the library become involved in Data Equity for Main Street?
- DEMS9 has known Will Saunders for years, and heard about the project from him. 

## What Data Equity activities did the library participate it?
- DEMS9 helped develop the curriculum. Another librarian at the library led the classes for the general public, with DEMS9 playing a small part in instruction. 

## What went well about classes? What could have gone better?
- The information in the curriculum is good, and can be tailored to the needs of a particular library or audience.
- Getting people to attend classes is a challenge. The classes had eight attendees -- six who completed all four classes. DEMS9 wonders if more targeted marketing (e.g., to community activist groups) would work better.

## What is the library's ideal role in open data programming? How does this meet the needs of the library's community?
- For DEMS9's library, the priority is helping the city with its open data publishing. 
- Despite attendance challenges for instruction, DEMS9 believes the library still has a strong role to play in teaching people to use open data. People need some education as a foundation for the next steps, "a little hook," DEMS9 said. As open data publishing evolves and provides a little more context and narrative, more people will be interested in open data, DEMS9 said. 
- DEMS9 would like to try another round of instruction, perhaps offering just the first class about what open data is, and perhaps to a more targeted audience of nonprofits or other likely users. 
- Libraries have a clear open data role, DEMS9 said. Libraries "definitely need to be at the table. We're the place of information, of education."

## What would help the library take the next step in open data services? 
- Time. 

## What might the State Library do to support open data services at public libraries?
- DEMS9 generally agreed with others' suggestions to provide toolkits, guides, best practices and professional development.
