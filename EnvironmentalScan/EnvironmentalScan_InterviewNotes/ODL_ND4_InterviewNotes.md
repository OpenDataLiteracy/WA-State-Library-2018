# ODL Interview Notes with ND4

*ND4 is the director of a large municipal library (serving 100K-250K people), with between 6 and 10 locations. ND4 took over the library directorship in the past year. The city has an open data portal, and the surrounding county publishes a lot of GIS open data.*

## What population does the library serve?
- The library serves an economically and racially/ethnically diverse area, but could be serving more of that population that its current services and events reflect, ND4 said. The library has not adequately talked to its public for many years, ND4 said. 
- The library is now undertaking strategic planning, beginning with conversations with residents in different neighborhoods. The conversations are aimed at identifying aspirations and challenges among city residents, so that the library can better serve their needs. (This gives the library better information than simply asking residents what they need from the library. Many residents may not be familiar enough with what libraries can offer to give a helpful answer. They may not "think of libraries as agents of change," ND4 said.) 
- The conversations have been organized and promoted by the library itself, using press releases, and library communication channels such as Facebook (which has been pretty successful). The library tries to hold conversations in non-library locations.  

## Does the library currently publish data about itself?
- No.
- The library intends to share publicly the findings from its neighborhood conversations, although this will likely take the form of a traditional narrative report rather than a dataset.
- The library doesn't currently have a staff member who specifically wrangles data. Staffing is generally pretty lean. The library doesn't have a communications/marketing staff member either, for example. 

## What is the library's relationship with local government and other community groups?
- The library is a "trust fund" of the city, meaning once money is allocated, it can't be taken away without an extraordinary step.  
- ND4 said the library has been isolated from other government functions for many years. ND4 is working to rebuild these relationships by meeting weekly with the city manager, for example, and reaching out to educational institutions/organizations (incl. public schools and local colleges) as well as social services and community groups (e.g., parks, housing authority, local faith-based organizations, historical societies etc.). 
- The neighborhood conversations generate data that the library can use when presenting to city officials. The city is starting to hear some positive feedback about the conversations and the library. 
- ND4 will reach out more to business leaders when the library's strategic direction has begun to take shape and the library can offer more services to this segment of the community. 

## Do open data services seem like a promising options for the library in the near future?
- Publishing, literacy instruction and open-data advising are all interesting options, and valuable ones, ND4 said, but they aren't the top priority right now, as the library is focused on addressing some fundamental strategic issues.
- If local government agencies decide to expand or improve their currently limited open data, ND4 would "definitely like to be at the table," as the library has expertise to contribute. The library can help public agencies understand the benefits of being open with information, and getting in front of public questions and concerns. The local governments have been grappling with records requests, and open data is seen as a way to relieve the burden of meeting those requests.
