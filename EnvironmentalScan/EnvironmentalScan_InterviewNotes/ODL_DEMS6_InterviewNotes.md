#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS6 Interview Notes
*Interview conducted via Zoom on 2018-07-19*

*DEMS6 is the director a Washington State municipal library serving 25K-100K people. The library's city doesn't publish open data; the county and its largest city publish limited open data (GIS). A university-community partnership has produced an extensive data portal for the county, using various public datasets.*

## What is the library's service population like?
- The city and surrounding area has historical connection to scientific military projects, and much of the population has at least a bachelor's degree. The library prioritizes STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) curriculum, in staffing (STEAM coordinator), facilities (STEAM space) and equipment (virtual reality goggles, three 3D printers). The emphasis with these programs is education (understanding anatomy), not only entertainment.

## How did the library become involved in Data Equity for Main Street?
- DEMS6 got a group email, possibly through Washington State Library.
- DEMS6 was interested in a way to educate citizens and improve the library's own command of data, to demonstrate the library's value to the community or grantmakers.
- Data Equity was the first time such an opportunity had come up, and it "just what was needed, when it was needed," DEMS6 said.

## What Data Equity activities has the library undertaken?
- DEM6 attended training in Sacramento and is now using the curriculum to train key staff, such as reference and computer literacy librarians.
- DEMS6 hopes to conduct classes for the general public in September.
- DEMS6 says there are opportunities, too, to fold the curriculum into existing programming such as STEAM or health literacy. 

## How will the library market classes to the public?
- The library has staff with good marketing, social media and design skills. 
- The library will reach out to likely user groups, such as people interested in health, users who are academic, or families. 

## What is the library's relationship with local government and community groups?
- The library used to be independent but is now a city agency, therefore reporting to city council and meeting regularly with other city leaders about matters like safety. The library board is also active, and will present to the city council about the library's strategic plan. 
- DEMS6 believes an advisory role on open data could happen "organically," as long as the library continues exploring open data and sharing information. 

## How are open data services part of the library's mission?
- Libraries are curators of information and resources, DEMS6 said. "We're giving people what they'd want if they knew about it," DEMS6 said
