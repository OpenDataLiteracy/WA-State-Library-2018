#  ODL DEMS8 Interview Notes

*DEMS8 is the director of a smaller county library (serving >5K <25K people). The local governments don't publish any open data. 

## How did the library become involved in Data Equity for Main Street?
- Elizabeth Iaukea in the State Library told the library about it. The library participates in technology/job training programs overseen by the State Library. 

## What Data Equity activities did the library participate it?
- DEMS8 and another librarian on staff were part of the initial Curriculum Committee as well as the Alpha Tester group. 
- DEMS8 and the other librarian suggested using "side-by-side" detailed lesson plans, to support instructors. They'd benefited from such lesson plans in "Flatverse" Learn-to-code curriculum used at the library. 
- The library also conducted a round of classes, which was attended by 8 people (Half were staff, and two were patrons that DEMS8 thought would be interested and had contacted.) 

## What went well about classes? What could have gone better?
- Open data is useful up to a point, DEMS8 said -- most especially when the information doesn't exist elsewhere, and when can work with the data and visualize it to tell a story. (DEMS8's "favorite thing" in the curriculum was a Hans Rosling video about using visualization to show changes in countries' income and overall life span.) 

## What sort of relationship does the library have with local government and community groups?
- DEMS8 regular attends Rotary meetings or other events with community leaders such as the police chief, does a radio show occasionally with a county commissioners and has collaborated closely with schools and the local port on such projects as bringing broadband to the area.
- DEMS8 would like to prod the local government into publishing more open data. 

## What is the library's ideal role in open data programming? 
- DEMS8 said it made sense to explore something new that connected the public to information, but isn't sure classes for the general public have enough impact to merit the work that goes into them.
- If more local open data were published in a user-friendly format, the public might have more enthusiasm for learning about open data. DEMS8's next step would be to nudge local government to publish open data. 

## What would help the library take the next step?
- Extra staffing, even temporarily, to help start a conversation with local government about open data publishing.
- The library has been engaged in a building project, which has taken up most of the director's time.
