#  ODL: ND6 Interview Notes

*ND6 is the director of a small (serving <5K people) rural library system spread out over a large area and several branches. Local government agencies do not currently publish open data.

## What population does the libary serve?
- The library's population comprises mainly young families and retirees, with very few middle-aged adults. The population is largely Caucasian, native English speakers. The area also has many low-income residents. 

## What does the library's event programming look like? 
- Since young families make up a lot of the library's service population, events target school-age children (with such programming on heavy rotation during summer months). However, the library also has active older patrons who participate in book clubs and food events. 

## How does the library interact with other public agencies?
- ND6 has a hand in most local governing bodies, and members of local agencies [*health department? review recording*] sit on the library's board. The library works closely with schools, and ND6 sits on the local museum board. ND6 attends school board, city countcil and chamber of commerce meetings. 

## Does the library publish any data about itself?
- No.

## How much does publishing, teaching or advising on open data seem like a likely future role for the library?
- All seem possible, especially if the library has toolkits, suggested starting points and clearly identified best practices to work with, ND6 said.
- Although patrons aren't currently asking about open data, ND6 says such questions seem possible in the "not far off" future. Ideally staff would receive training in teaching patrons to use open data to address reference questions. ND6 would not start with classes for the general public: Earlier attempts to host computer/technology classes have been woefully underattended, despite enthusiastic promotion and the fact that patrons say they want such classes, ND6 said. However, individuals who attend drop-in technology help sessions, or approach the reference desk, are very receptive to instruction. 
- The library would also be interested in nudging local government toward publishing open data, especially if staff had training about how to start the conversation. 
- ND6 is less sure about publishing library open data, but would be open to it with support and tools for doing so.
