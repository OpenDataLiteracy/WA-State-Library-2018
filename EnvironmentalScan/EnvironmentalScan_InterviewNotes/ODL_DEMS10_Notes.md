#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS10 Notes

*DEMS10 is the IT manager for a rural county library serving 5K to 25K people. The county has limited GIS open data, but the area has another data portal generated by a university/community partnership.*

## What Data Equity for Main Street classes did the library undertake?
- The library had a Train-the-Trainer class for managers in March 2018. 
- Because a lot of the staff do not have strong computer skills, the class was an amalgam of computer basics (online search engines, Boolean operators) and Data Equity curriculum from the first two classes. 

## What went well? What could have gone better?
- The custom curriculum worked well, DEMS10 said. The staff needed some tech foundation before jumping into open data.

## What are next steps on open data?
- The library hopes to continue offering Data Equity curriculum in October.
- The library is consumed with a big project updating its automation system, and will resume open data efforts when the automation update and necessary training have taken place.
