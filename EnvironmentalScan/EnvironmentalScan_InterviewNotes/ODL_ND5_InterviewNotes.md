#  ODL: ND5 Interview notes

ND5 is a data analyst and instructor for a large (> 250K patrons) municipal library. The municipality has many residents who work for technology companies and a Code for America chapter.

## Does the library publish data about itself?
- Yes. As a municipal agency, the library is subject to a mayoral executive order from several years ago, calling for all city data to be made as accessible as possible (while protecting privacy, security and quality).
- The library publishes datasets about inventory and checkouts. Other city datasets also include the library -- for example, surveys of cultural spaces. 

## How does publishing open data affect the library's perspective on open data?
- The library has experienced both the reward and frustration of publishing open data. 
- The library understands from experience the challenges of trying to select data that particularly interests the public, and present it with appropriate context. 
- The library understands the benefits of complete metadata, and fills in all of the fields. 
- Staff recently noticed a visualization of library data on social media, which must have been generated by user who downloaded the open dataset -- exactly the sort of use intended by publication. The library also got a request for some extra metadata from data science platform Kaggle, so the data is getting attention. 
- On the other hand, library middle managers were anxious about data being "misinterpreted" -- a common concern among non-library city departments called to publish open data. On the one hand, ND5 said, even good metadata doesn't necessarily provide the interpretation that the library might want -- a dataset might simply show that acquisitions have gone down, without showing that the budget had been reduced. On the other hand, concerns about misinterpretation can be answered with, "That's what starts a conversation. Respond to what they've misinterpreted. Provide context. Maybe you should publish some more open data."
- Uploading data was also extremely cumbersome, because the library has a separate domain than most other city departments (as many other municipal libraries do). At times, for example, the library actually had to have someone at the city send form questions by email, rather than filling out the electronic form directly. 

## Does the library advise other city departments about publishing open data?
- Not so far. The library has simply been another data publisher.
- But interaction between the library and other city departments has steadily grown, from practically none a decade ago, ND5 said.
- City departments get more than 10K records requests a year. Open data is one promising means of reducing records requests. 
- The library's open information commitment and experience may benefit other city departments, ND5 said, noting that it's possible the library gets reduced record requests because patrons can get the information via email to the library. 
- 

## Has the library provided instruction on using open data?
- The library generated and conducted two open data workshops in 2017, one for the general public and one for staff. 
- The workshop for the general public was underattended, with two or three people showing up. This was after promoting the workshop not only through the usual channels (flyers, library calendar of events), but personally inviting members of 20 community-based groups involved in social justice. 
- The general public workshop itself seemed "like it fell flat," ND5 said. Users have a wide range of skills and interests when it comes to data, with some capable of digesting and transforming data, and others simply consumers of someone else's storytelling. ND5 wonders if open data is something that is better suited to "just in time" help at a reference desk, with a research librarian. 
- By contrast, an open data workshop for staff attracted more than 50 reference/subject librarians, including a few from other public library systems. The reception was enthusiastic, and the library received a few thank-you emails. The library has not tracked how the attending librarians are using open data in their work. 

## Based on this experience with open data, what is the library's ideal role in advancing open data?
- ND5 wonders if energy might not be best directed toward improving internal use of data for quality improvement, within the library and other city departments. Using data this way means people see the benefits of high quality data management; with open-data publishing, publishing agencies often don't see the impact (apart from measuring views or downloads). 
- ND5 said it might be interesting to show patrons how they can use data analysis on the library's datasets -- for example, generate their own reader's advisory lists by doing proximity analysis among titles. 
- But the library also has to take care to protect confidentiality -- just knowing that patrons have any kind of an identifier may creep some people out.
