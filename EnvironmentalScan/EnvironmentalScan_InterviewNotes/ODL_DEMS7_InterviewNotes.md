#  DEMS7 Interview Notes
Interview conducted over the phone 23 July 2018

DEMS7 is a librarian at a large county library (serving >250K people). The county includes a large city as well as colleges and universities. 

## How library became involved
- Another managing librarian applied to participate [*how did that person learn about DEMS*] and DEMS8 was tapped to lead instruction, probably due to experience with business and career development work. 

## What Data Equity activities they undertook
- DEMS8 has led two rounds of classes, one in April 2018 aimed specifically at the business/economic development community, and another in July 2018 aimed at the general public. 
- April classes were attended by about 7 participants. July classes were attended by two.
- The library doesn't have current plans for future classes. 

## What went well 
- DEMS8 combined Classes 1&2, and Classes 3&4, to create two classes. The tailored curriculum spent a little less time on metadata (which DEMS8 believes interests librarians more than it does many users) and less time on Class 4 content such as giving feedback. The classes focused primarily on what open data is, where to find and how to use it -- along with exploring on one's own -- which DEMS8 believes is more in line with user interests.
- Participants seemed enthusiastic about what they learned.
- Generating maps and charts was an especially popular part of the classes.
- The July students drove across town to participate in the class -- which the library knew because it recently added zip codes to some of its assessment tools!

## What could have gone better
- The April classes were marketed by a separate local nonprofit focused on business and economic development. The nonprofit pitched the classes as being more focused on marketing research, and the class participants had expected different material. 
- Although class participants were asked to bring a laptop or request one for the library, many April class participants didn't do either. So they simply had to watch demonstrations rather than follow along or explore themselves. (DEMS8 made sure July class participants had a device.)

## Does open-data programming fit the demands of the library's service community?
- DEMS8 says the library doesn't necessarily get a lot of research-based queries from patrons, not in class or at the information desk. Library classes and events tend to focus on activities that are fun or recreational (e.g., knitting, music appreciation) rather than research-based. The local population most likely to have research-based queries are those connected to the area's colleges and universities, and these institutions may better serve those patrons through their own academic libraries.
