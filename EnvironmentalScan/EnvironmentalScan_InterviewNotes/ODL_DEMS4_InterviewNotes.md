#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS4 Interview Notes

*DEMS4 is the integrated library systems coordinator for a California municipal library serving more than 1 million residents. The city and surrounding county both have open data portals, as well as a Code for America chapter.*

## How did the library come to be involved in Data Equity for Main Street?
- The library director had heard about the project at the California Library Association confernce and applied to the project. 
- The library director tapped DEMS4 to spearhead the Data Equity effort. DEMS4 has a background in data and statistics (including an advanced degree in a social science) and is part of the library's IT team. 

## What Data Equity activities did the library undertake?
- DEMS4 helped develop the Data Equity curriculum. 
- The library led the four-course curriculum for the general public during the Alpha phase.

## How did the library promote the classes?
- The classes were advertised to the general public, including on social media.

## What went well with the classes? What could have gone better?
- The classes were attended by about 16 people, at the start. 
- The library probably should have been clearer that the curriculum was aimed at beginners. Class participants with more background in coding dropped out, but about eight participants continued for all four classes.
- The remaining participants were very engaged. Treasure hunts and critical thinking about visualizations were especially popular parts of the curriculum.
- The Data Equity curriculum committee debated whether to have students all work on the same project, or pursue their own special projects. Based on the class experience, DEMS4 said it was better to have everyone working on the same project, with vetted open data sources. An alternative approach would be to give students an optional 20 minutes at the end to work on their own projects, with instructional support.

## What is the library's role in the local open data portal?
- The library is a participant and contributes datasets, like other city agencies do. 

## How much do open data services (publishing, instruction, advising) fit the library's mission?
- DEMS4 said open data fits well with the library's literacy mission, and is also an important critical-thinking tool during a time when "we're dealing with an all-out assault on facts."
