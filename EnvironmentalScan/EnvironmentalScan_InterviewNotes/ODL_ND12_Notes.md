​Hi, Kathleen,
​
​Thanks for your question. [ND12] hasn’t done any significant projects around open data as of yet, but it’s on our radar for the future. We have just launched a Data Coordination Team that will eventually make some recommendations around how we join the open data movement. We have some internal work to do before we’ll be ready for that.
​
​If you have any additional questions, please reach out.
​
​Thanks,
[ND12 staff]
