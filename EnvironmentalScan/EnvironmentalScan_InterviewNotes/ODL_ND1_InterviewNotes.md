#  ODL ND1 Interview Notes

*ND1 is the technology and collections manager of a smaller municipal library, serving about 25K people (although it also serves other patrons through a cooperative venture with other areas). The library has gotten a new director in the past few years, and ND1 is also relatively new in the position. The library's town has recently launched an open data portal, as part of an "open government" initiative.*

## What is the library's service population like? 
- The town is fairly affluent and close to a major city. 
- Young families are the top priority. The library has nine Storytimes a week, and they are packed. 
- The area includes a number of immigrant populations, including Spanish, Russian, Portuguese and Korean speakers. The library offers Storytime in these languages, for example. 

## What is the library's relationship with local government and community groups?
- The library is another city department head.
- The local school district is very strong and operates on its own, without much collaboration with the library.
- The town's finance department has spearheaded the open data push. (The city's public records department is also jumping into using Laserfiche.) So far the library has been involved as a participant -- another city department head and potential publisher -- rather than an advisor. ND1 can see potential for the library serving an advisory role eventually.

## Does the library publish data about itself?
- Not yet. 
- As the town's open data efforts evolve, the library is hoping publishing datasets such as circulation. The library would like to tell its story with something more qualitative and contextual, though, ND1 said.
- The library uses data internally to track performance and prioritize.

## To what extent do open data roles (teaching, advising, publishing) seem like an option for the library in the near future?
- ND1 sees teaching and advocacy/advising as solid possibilities, especially as open data expands in the local area. The library isn't getting many questions at the reference desk about the town's open data, but the portal is still pretty new. 

## What would help the library take the next step in open data services?
- Capacity. The library is always short on time and staff, and the library has other major efforts going on right now, including a new ILS, strategic planning and hiring.
