#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS5a&b Interview Notes

*DEMS5a & DEMS5b are innovations director and web librarian for a California municipal public library serving about 1 million people. The city and surrounding county both have open data portals. The area has many tech employers and a Code for America chapter.

## Has the library worked with the city on its open data portal?
- The library is in the process of getting such a partnership underway. 
- The city's open data portal quality is poor -- with inadequate documentation, little updating and low use. The platform also needs to be updated, DEMS5a said.
- The city also needs data management policies that allow departments to share data with each other.

## What is the library's relationship with the city and other local agencies?
- The library's director has a good relationship with the city's information officer and other city leaders. The director makes sure other leaders know about library expertise and areas for potential collaboration. "They're not going to come to you," DEMS5a said. "You have to the advocate."
- The library has long experience with using data to improve operations and demonstrate value, and everyday experience with users, DEMS5a&b said. 
- The library collaborates with schools and is recognized formally as an education specialist, and has offered help to the city on matters such as data privacy.

## What activities did the library undertake with Data Equity for Main Street?
- DEMS5a&b helped develop the curriculum, emphasizing easy-to-follow steps for people who don't necessarily have a data background. (DEMS5a has a background in writing such plans and in theater education.)
- The library conducted classes for the general public in the Alpha phase, and also taught the curriculum to staff.

## What went well with Data Equity activities? What could have gone better?
- The library has good instruction facilities and equipment, including a laptop cart.
- Public classes had about eight attendees consistently, although not always the same eight. DEMS5b said promoting classes and connecting the content to local data sources are challenging but important.
- Classes for staff were very well attended, with at least 30 people showing up. They may offer another round of classes [for staff?] this fall. 

## How much do open data services (publishing, instruction, advising) seem to fit the library's mission? What are possible next steps?
- It "seems like a really natural fit to me," [x] said.
- LIbraries are "originally open source," DEMS5a said. "LIbraries are about literacy. ...[Open data] is just a new form of literacy."
- The library is getting a permanent staff position for data, which DEMS5a&b will help advance open data programming.
- DEMS5a&b are also exploring creating e-curriculum that can be embedded into an open data portal, so users can learn more about open data even if they can't attend a class.

## What can the State Library do to advance open data services at public libraries?
- Offer training. 
- Give libraries tools and tips about how to start a conversation with their local governments on open data publishing.
