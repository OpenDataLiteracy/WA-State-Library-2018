#  ODL Environmental Scan: DEMS5a&b Interview Notes

*DEMS5a & DEMS5b are innovations director and web librarian for a California municipal public library serving about 1 million people. The city and surrounding county both have open data portals. The area has many colleges and universities, tech employers and a Code for America chapter.*

## Has the library worked with the city on its open data portal?
- The library has expressed interest in such a partnership, to improve the city's open data once, as well as offer continued training and support. 
- The city's open data portal quality is poor -- with inadequate documentation (e.g., police codes with no legend, intersections listed rather than addresses that translate easily to visualization), little updating, low participation and low use by the public. The city doesn't have policies that foster continuous participation, DEMS5a&b said. 
- The city's open data platform is now in the process of being replaced, DEMS5a said.
- The city also needs data management policies that allow departments to share data with each other, for their own benefit. For example, during recent flooding, different city departments couldn't adequately share data to coordinate relief efforts.

## Does the library currently publish open data?
- [Library's local archive  appears to be publishing some map data]

## What is the library's relationship with the city and other local agencies?
- The library's director has a good relationship with the city's information officer and other city leaders. The director makes sure other leaders know about library expertise and value for potential collaboration. (DEMS5a says it's the library's "responsibility to make their city officials see that value. ...They're not going to come to you, usually. You've got to be your advocate. That's the thing I think I see missing sometimes from libraries. You have to go out there and tell them, and show them.") The mayor also seems to recognize the library's value and holds it up as an example to other city departments, DEMS5a said.
- The library has long experience with using data to improve operations and demonstrate value ("That's how you keep your doors open," DEMS5b said), and everyday experience with users, DEMS5a&b said. Outcomes-based assessment is a hot topic in libraries, DEMS5b said, and libraries are in a good position to train others to carry out this assessment effectively. 
- The library oversees a collaborate among local school superintendents and the city and is recognized formally as an educational institution for the city (helping to write policy and setting quality standards). It is also working with the city on a new data privacy policy, and participates in emergency planning with the city. 

## What activities did the library undertake with Data Equity for Main Street?
- DEMS5a&b helped develop the curriculum, emphasizing easy-to-follow steps for people who don't necessarily have a data background. (DEMS5a has a background in writing program plans and in theater education.)
- DEMS5b conducted the very first round of classes for the general public in the Alpha phase, and also taught the curriculum to staff.

## What went well with Data Equity activities? What could have gone better?
- The library has good instruction facilities (computer lab, open conference space) and equipment, including a laptop cart.
- Public classes had about eight attendees consistently, although not always the same eight. The attendees had a variety of reasons for attending, some with specific goals in mind, a few staff interested in improving customer service, as well as beginners. The classes were held on four Saturdays in a row. 
- Based on DEMS5 library's own experience and perusing comments from Beta testing libraries, DEMS5b said marketing/promotion is very important, and is being prepared and and connecting the content to community. DEMS5b, for example, brought in community open data partners as guests for the last class. 
- The library also hosted classes in May 2018 for staff, over two days. These were very well attended, with at least 30 people showing up. Attendees were very engaged, used visualization after the classes, and asked if the library would be offering instruction again. They may offer another round of classes for staff and other city departments this fall. 
- The staff training was also important for helping staff to understand how their daily routine might be affected by the library's publishing more open data, and how they might use open data internally to direct services and demonstrate value (e.g., gather information for a neighborhood assessment). "This is planting a seed to get them thinking, Oh, I could be one of the data champions," DEMS5b said.

## How much do open data services (publishing, instruction, advising) seem to fit the library's mission? What are possible next steps?
- It "seems like a really natural fit to me," DEMS5a said.
- LIbraries are "the original open source people," DEMS5a said. "The data that governments collect and create really belongs to the people. Libraries are about literacy and about teaching people how to access information -- not just providing access to it. If the data's not usable, that includes you not knowing how to use it. Traditionally we've done book literacy -- we've taught people how to read, so they can unlock that information that's in a book. [Open data] is just another form of literacy. In order to access that data, in order to make it readable, in order to understand it and use it, you have to have the skillset, that literacy." Otherwise large institutions such as big business are the only ones with open data power, DEMS5a said.
- The library is getting a permanent staff position for data, which DEMS5a&b will help advance open data programming and perhaps offer another round of classes for the public. 
- DEMS5a&b are also exploring creating e-curriculum that can be offered on the libary website and embedded into an open data portal, so users can have an immediate option for learning more about open data, if they can't attend a class in person. The trick is also to develop outcomes measures to track how curriculum is used.

## What can the State Library do to advance open data services at public libraries?
- Offer training, especially leadership and advocacy training.
- Small stipends for doing this work would be helpful. 
- Give libraries tools and tips about how to start a conversation with their local governments on open data publishing (not overwhelm agencies that aren't anywhere near ready for open data, or whose constituencies aren't demanding it).
- Reassure libraries that these are long-term strategies that will take years to take hold, DEMS5a&b now. It's important to start early and demonstrate that the library is a valuable institution that is critical to the function of the community.
