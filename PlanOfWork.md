# Washington State Library: Supporting Libraries as Open Data Educators and Advisors

**Description**   
The University of Washington Information School’s Open Data Literacy (ODL) project works with public institutions to create, manage and publish open data. ODL intern Kathleen Sullivan will help the project sponsor, the Washington State Library (WSL), identify ways to support open data literacy programs and services at public libraries statewide. Kathleen will start by organizing materials from a recent open data literacy pilot project at California and Washington State public libraries. Building on lessons from this pilot project, she’ll develop a plan for assessing Washington state public libraries’ readiness as open data educators and advisors, and suggest supporting roles and next steps for ODL and WSL through at least Summer 2019. Stakeholders served include the WSL, public agencies publishing open data, public libraries statewide and the general public that they serve.

**Goals**     
What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?

*Create a public repository of materials from the Data Equity for Mainstreet (DEMS) program*
Data Equity for Main Street (DEMS), a John S. and James L. Knight Foundation project, has piloted open data education at more than 20 public library systems (and several academic libraries) in Washington state and California since Fall 2017. The repository will serve as a curriculum resource for all libraries. Kathleen will investigate options for the Washington State Library to 

*Conduct an environmental scan to assess readiness of public libraries to offer open data services*
statewide for fostering open data literacy and advising public agencies about the usability of open data they publish (without compromising patron confidentiality or other ethical obligations), and identify ways WSL might support public libraries’ role in promoting open data literacy and quality. 
- Propose next steps for ODL and WSL to collaborate in incubating public library open data projects. Propose continued ODL internship contributions through at least Summer 2019. The proposal should address the role of other state agencies with significant open data initiatives, such as the Washington State Archives. 
- Draft presentation material about Washington State libraries’ open data literacy progress, and the role of the state library, for dissemination in journals or at conferences.

*Out of scope*

Earlier work plan drafts included activities to help libraries themselves publish open data. Kathleen and WSL/sponsor supervisors Cindy Aden and Evelyn Lindberg decided not to include this goal in the updated work plan, due to time constraints. Kathleen will note any information about libraries as publishers in her research, and address possible opportunities in her proposal for future ODL/WSL collaboration.  

*Time allowing*

Earlier work plan drafts included possible site visits to participating libraries. Kathleen is enthusiastically open to site visits, as time allows. 


**Deliverables**    

*Interim*     
- Minimum weekly progress reports to Evelyn Lindberg at WSL, who will serve as Kathleen’s direct supervisor during the internship, and Will Saunders, DEMS leader at the Washington state Office of the Chief Information Officer.
- Weekly documentation in GitHub and two public blog posts, as required by the ODL internship guidelines. 
- Presentation about ODL internship work at July 11 WSL staff meeting.

*End of project*
- Public repository of DEMS materials. 
- Instrument and plan for statewide assessment of public library readiness for open data literacy roles, and options for WSL support.
- Proposal for next steps that ODL and WSL might take together to continue incubating open data programs and services at public libraries. 
- Draft journal or conference presentation material about Washington state public libraries’ open-data literacy programs and services, and the WSL role in supporting it.
- Public presentation of internship work, as required by ODL internship guidelines. Date and forum to be determined.


**Plan for Sustainability**       
- Kathleen will propose a sustainable, low-fee or free platform for the DEMS repository, and will evaluate WSL’s potential role in providing that platform. As part of the repository development, Kathleen will identify who will maintain and update the repository when her internship concludes.
- The plan for next steps for ODL and WSL will propose who could continue the assessment of library readiness for open data programs and services, including launch of any assessment instrument and analysis of responses.
- Kathleen also will hand off draft presentation material to designated WSL or other staff who will use it for journals or upcoming conferences.

**Milestones**  

*Create repository for DEMS materials*
- Conduct foundational research for repository plan: Inventory and review DEMS artifacts stored on the Basecamp project site. Talk to Will and other DEMS teaching librarians about ideal content and functionality for a sustainable useful repository. Pull together information about best practices or exemplar U.S. public library open-data roles. Complete foundational research by July 3. 
- Select a platform for the repository. The platform should be sustainable, functional and accessible. Kathleen should evaluate the potential for WSL to provide the platform. Dependency: Recommendations from WSL and others about platform options. Propose platform choice in July 6 repository draft plan, finalize by July 12. 
- Propose a repository plan, including suggested platform option. The plan should also propose who will maintain and update the repository when Kathleen’s internship concludes. Complete draft plan by July 6; finalize plan by July 12.
- Upload artifacts and other content to the repository. Complete by July 23.
- Test the repository with DEMS participants and WSL staff. Improve as needed. Complete testing and improvements by July 27. 
- Publish the repository, and publicize its launch through appropriate channels (e.g., WSL social media, library directors’ listserv). Launch by July 30.
- Hand off maintenance of the repository to the person who will maintain it going forward. Hand off at launch.

*Develop instrument for assessing public library open-data readiness*

- Research model roles for libraries in promoting open data literacy and quality, as part of initial foundational research. Complete by July 3.
- Consult ODL staff and other UW faculty about assessment tool options. Complete by July 3.
- Generate proposed assessment plan, synthesizing information from DEMS/literature review, as well as expert input on assessment options. List essential information that any assessment should gather, and how this information will inform next steps for WSL. Distribute to WSL and DEMS leaders for review. Generate this summary/proposal for review by July 11. 
- Review assessment plan, incorporating feedback from sponsor, ODL staff. Revise remaining steps as necessary. [Review and update assessment process plan by July 16.]
- Draft an assessment instrument, such as a survey or interview protocol. Review with WSL staff, DEMSleadership and ODL staff/UW faculty. Choose an instrument platform that WSL staff can easily take over and monitor when Kathleen’s internship concludes. [Dates subject to final assessment process plan.]
- Test assessment tool with a small sample. Improve as needed. [Dates subject to final assessment process plan.]
- If time allows, launch instrument at all Washington State public library systems, gather and analyze responses. OR, if time is short, hand off the assessment process to appropriate WSL staff member. Generate written plan for assessment process, including steps that may take place after Kathleen’s internship concludes. Propose ways that ODL and WSL can continue to collaborate on the assessment process. [Dates subject to final assessment process plan.]

*Propose next steps for ODL and WSL collaboration* 

- Visit Washington State Archives during internship, to learn more about work promoting open data publication by public agencies. By Aug. 3. 
- Generate a written proposal of next steps to carry forward work begun with Kathleen’s internship. The proposal should suggest future internships and other collaboration opportunities between ODL and WSL, through Summer 2019. Suggestions should be grounded in research and discussions during the internship, and reflect the DEMSpilot project experience, responses (if any) from the assessment, and best practices or exemplar public library open-data programs elsewhere in the U.S. The proposal should also address the potential role of other Washington State agencies with substantial open-data roles, such as the Washington State Archives. Generate proposal by Aug.6. 

*Generate draft report or presentation to use in journals or at conferences*

- Choose a format for draft presentation material (e.g., draft article, poster, multimedia presentation) in consultation with WSL and ODL staff. Designate format by July 20. 
- Designate who will take over draft material when Kathleen’s internship concludes, or whether Kathleen will present material at future events. Finalize by July 20. 
- Generate draft material that can be used in journals or at conferences, to disseminate Washington State public libraries’ open-data literacy work, and showcase the role of WSL, DEMS and ODL in supporting this work. Generate draft material by Aug. 7.

*Changes to the work plan* 

Priorities will be adjusted as needed in consultation with project sponsors and the ODL team. All changes will be documented on Github and in Kathleen’s minimum weekly reports to Evelyn, Will and other staff.

**Communication**

- Kathleen will see Evelyn daily and document her progress in written updates (e.g., email or Basecamp) to Evelyn and Will by close of day Friday, at a minimum. 
- She will update the ODL GitHub repository at least weekly, so the internship’s documentation is current and thorough. 
- She will respond to any inquiries from WSL staff, DEMS participants or ODL peers within 24 hours. Monday through Friday, she will be able to respond within 4 hours (if not sooner), between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
- She will use email, BaseCamp, Slack (for ODL), cell phone and other communication tools for easy access and quick response.
- Kathleen will visit DEMS participating libraries or other public library sites, as needed by the sponsor and as time and budgets permit.
