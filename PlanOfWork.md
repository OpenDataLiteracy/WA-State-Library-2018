# Washington State Library: Supporting Libraries as Open Data Educators and Advisors

## Description
The University of Washington Information School’s Open Data Literacy (ODL) project works with public institutions to create, manage and publish open data. ODL intern Kathleen Sullivan will help the project sponsor, the Washington State Library (WSL), identify ways to support open data literacy programs and services at public libraries statewide. Kathleen will start by organizing materials from a recent open data literacy pilot project at California and Washington State public libraries. Building on lessons from this pilot project, she’ll conduct an environmental scan of Washington state public libraries’ readiness as open data educators and advisors, and suggest supporting roles and next steps for ODL and WSL through at least Summer 2019. Stakeholders served include the WSL, public agencies publishing open data, public libraries statewide and the general public that they serve.

## Goals     
What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?

### Create a public repository of materials from the Data Equity for Mainstreet (DEMS) program
Data Equity for Main Street (DEMS), a John S. and James L. Knight Foundation project, has piloted open data education at more than 20 public library systems (and several academic libraries) in Washington state and California since Fall 2017. The repository will serve as a curriculum resource for all libraries. Kathleen will investigate options for the Washington State Library to support the repository.

### Conduct an environmental scan to assess readiness of public libraries to offer open data services
Kathleen will conduct an environmental scan of municipal/county open data publishing and public library open-data programs in Washington State. Specifically, she will talk to Data Equity participating libraries about what helped or hindered their open-data efforts, review Data Equity evaluations and message boards for similar insights, contact a sample of non-participating public libraries about their own open-data readiness and challenges and contact other recommended agencies engaged in open-data literacy or publishing (e.g., Washington State Archives). She will also start mapping which localities in Washington State publish open data already. Finally, she will contact libraries that have worked closely with local government to help publish or improve open data, to generate case studies on library-government partnerships. The final report and presentation will give the State Library a foundation for determining possible next steps, synthesize takeaways for Data Equity, and provide material for conferences or journals.

### Propose next steps for ODL and WSL to collaborate in incubating public library open data projects
Propose continued ODL internship contributions through at least Summer 2019. The proposal should address the role of other state agencies with significant open data initiatives, such as the Washington State Archives. 

### *Out of scope*
Earlier work plan drafts included activities to help libraries themselves publish open data. Kathleen and WSL/sponsor supervisors Cindy Aden and Evelyn Lindberg decided not to include this goal in the updated work plan, due to time constraints. Kathleen will note any information about libraries as publishers in her research, and address possible opportunities in her proposal for future ODL/WSL collaboration.  

### *Time allowing*
Earlier work plan drafts included possible site visits to participating libraries. Kathleen is enthusiastically open to site visits, as time allows. 


## Deliverables

### Interim     
- Weekly documentation in GitHub and two public blog posts, as required by the ODL internship guidelines. These will also serve as updates to Evelyn Lindberg at WSL, and Will Saunders at OCIO/Data Equity.
- Presentation about ODL internship work at July 11 WSL staff meeting.

### End of project 
- Public repository of DEMS materials. 
- Report on environmental scan, which will include material for dissemination in journals or at conferences
- Proposal for next steps that ODL and WSL might take together to continue incubating open data programs and services at public libraries. 
- Public presentation of internship work, as required by ODL internship guidelines. Date and forum to be determined.


## Plan for Sustainability     
- Kathleen will propose a sustainable, low-fee or free platform for the DEMS repository, and will evaluate WSL’s potential role in providing that platform. As part of the repository development, Kathleen will identify who will maintain and update the repository when her internship concludes.
- Kathleen final report will include material that can be handed off to sponsors for dissemination in journals or at upcoming conferences. She is open to presenting the material herself, subject to other obligations and sponsors' wishes.

### *Changes to the work plan* 
Priorities will be adjusted as needed in consultation with project sponsors and the ODL team. All changes will be documented on Github and in Kathleen’s minimum weekly reports.

## Communication

- Kathleen will update the ODL GitHub repository at least weekly and more as neded, so the internship’s documentation is current and thorough. She will notify Evelyn, Will and others as needed about updated reports.
- She will respond to any inquiries from WSL staff, DEMS participants or ODL peers within 24 hours. Monday through Friday, she will be able to respond within 4 hours (if not sooner), between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
- She will use email, BaseCamp, Slack (for ODL), cell phone and other communication tools for easy access and quick response.
- Kathleen will visit DEMS participating libraries or other public library sites, as needed by the sponsor and as time and budgets permit.
