#  Literature Search Notes

## Library and Information Science Source
- (DE "Public libraries" OR DE "Adult services in public libraries" OR DE "Central libraries" OR DE "Community-school libraries" OR DE "Regional libraries" OR DE "Rural libraries") + (TX or SU) open data movement = 5 results (mostly relevant)
    - Searching "open data" instead of "open data movement" only yielded more irrelevant results (27 total). 
    - Searching SU public libraries + open data movement yields slightly different list of 8 results (nothing new)
- (DE "Libraries & education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; adult education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; continuing education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; distance education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; home schooling" OR DE "Libraries &amp; students") + open data = 1 result (2011, too broad and not current)
