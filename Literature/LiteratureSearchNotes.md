#  Literature Search Notes

## Library and Information Science Source
- (DE "Public libraries" OR DE "Adult services in public libraries" OR DE "Central libraries" OR DE "Community-school libraries" OR DE "Regional libraries" OR DE "Rural libraries") + (TX or SU) open data movement = 5 results (mostly relevant)
    - Searching "open data" instead of "open data movement" only yielded more irrelevant results (27 total). 
    - Searching SU public libraries + open data movement yields slightly different list of 8 results (nothing new)
- (DE "Libraries & education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; adult education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; continuing education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; distance education" OR DE "Libraries &amp; home schooling" OR DE "Libraries &amp; students") + open data = 1 result (2011, too broad and not current)

## Library and Information Science Abstracts
- (SU public libraries + SU open data)/limit since 2013, English = 14 results. One was an article I'd already found through LISS; the rest were irrelevant, dealing with non-public libraries and/or cataloging or other library internal data systems.
- SU adult learning + SU public libraries/limit since 2013, English = 6 results, none relevant. (One was on general digital literacy for workforce development; didn't deal with open data.)
- SU Big Data + SU public libraries/limit since 2013, English = 7 results. Yields one somewhat related set of interviews about various librarians roles and Big Data.
- Tried other combinations with Big Data, digital literacy, open data (all anywhere in the text) and SU public libraries, mostly yielding >100 results without many relevant results. 

## INSPEC
- Tried various combinations using INSPEC Controlled Vocabulary (e.g., information science, government data processing etc). Most results sets were large (>250) and not relevant to my interest in public library roles in publishing, teaching or assisting in the publication of open government data. Likely reflects inexperience with searching in this database. A handful of library/data articles I came across concerned mostly scientific open data and academic research libraries.

## ACM Digital Library
- Tried various combinations of searches combining ("public libraries" OR "public library") and "open data," "data literacy," computer education -- limiting all since 2013. No results on point about public library roles in publishing, teaching or assisting in the publication of open government data; one article addressed the struggle among public libraries to define their future (Costantino et al., 2014) but wasn't on point. Search results likely reflect less experience searching in this database. 

## American Library Association, Reference & User Services Association, Public Library Association
- Searched general ALA site and RUSA and PLA subsections for documentation about any role of public libraries in open government data. Found a webpage for recent training, but no other recent (since 2013) documentation other than [ALA's "Open Government" position page](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/govinfo/opengov). ACRL has a 2017 [*Curating Research Data* guide](http://www.ala.org/acrl/sites/ala.org.acrl/files/content/publications/booksanddigitalresources/digital/9780838988596_crd_v1_OA.pdf), but this is geared toward research data and academic libraries.

## Sunlight Foundation 
- Search for "library," "libraries" on Sunlight Foundation website yielded hundreds of results, but none specifically addressing public library roles in promotion of open government data, since 2013.
Google Advanced Search of Sunlight Foundation for (libraries + "open data") yielded a few pages concerning open government:
    - [Boston Public Library and OpenGov Voices](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2017/01/17/opengov-voices-making-open-data-more-accessible-three-lessons-from-boston/)
    - [Cleveland Public Library hosts unconference about govt transparency](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/09/12/opengov-voices-from-open-shelves-to-open-data-at-transparencycamp-2016/)
